* Prerequisites
** GNU/Linux OS
** convert
   http://www.imagemagick.org
** Emacs >= 24
   Preferably with imagemagick support.
** poppler-glib
   Any version will do, but some will do better.
    - >= 0.12 :: Extracting outline and document title.
    - >= 0.16 :: Extracting metadata and document text.
    - >= 0.22 :: Searching case-sensitive.
** glib
   This is obviously a prerequisite for poppler-glib.  I don't know
   the minimally required version at the moment.
            
* Building
  This should be as simple as
#+begin_src sh
  ./configure && make
#+end_src
  , which compiles the c source and creates a ELPA package.

* Installation
  Assuming the epdfinfo server build correctly and a Emacs package was
  created.  The next step is to install this package, either with make
  via
#+begin_src sh
  make install
#+end_src
  or by hand from within Emacs via
#+begin_src elisp
  M-x package-install-file RET pdf-tools-${VERSION}.tar RET
#+end_src

  Now put
#+begin_src elisp
  (pdf-tools-install)
#+end_src
  in your .emacs and that's it.

* Usage (in a nutshell):
** Isearch
   Press C-s to enter isearch, try it.  While in isearch mode, C-v
   and C-M-v turn pages, C-b enters batch mode (try it), C-d enters
   dark mode (try it).
** Outline
   Press o to enter the outline buffer, assuming the PDF has one.
   Or use the menu-bar item 'PDF Outline', the tool bar or the imenu
   command.
** Links and the History
   After DocView has converted the document, you should start to see
   links underlined by some red pixel. (This is purely a visual
   cue.)  Click on such a link to activate it, or press f and select
   it with the keyboard. Press B to return to the original page and
   N to move (again) to the page of the just followed link.
** Miscellanous
   Drag the mouse over a region, this kills the selected text.
   Press C-w to copy the whole page.  M-s o invokes pdf-occur (but
   no regexp). I displays some metainformation about the document, s
   p and s w optimize the display to the page, respectively
   window-width. C-c C-d enters dark mode, which influences the
   color choices made (but not retroactively).
